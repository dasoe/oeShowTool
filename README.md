# oeShowTool

This is an openFrameworks Tool. 
Please visit http://openframeworks.cc to download & get to know it. It is very worth checking it out!
 

The tool will be used for driving shows based on video projection. 
This is an early alpha version, but already features different screens with mapping/warping and a bezier based mask editor.
The screens are connected to input slots (color, image, video), scenes are used to store all settings.

TODO:

- descriptions/help
- error catching
- check multi monitor problems on ubuntu
- add windows version (with gstreamer)
